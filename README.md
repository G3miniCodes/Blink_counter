# 👀 Blink Counter  

### 🎯 *Real-Time Blink Detection Using OpenCV*  

The *Blink Counter* is a simple yet effective computer vision project that detects and counts blinks in a video stream. Using *OpenCV*, it processes the video frames, identifies eye blinks, and displays the total blink count in real time.  

## ✨ *Features*  
🔹 *Real-time Blink Detection* – Counts blinks as they occur.  
🔹 *OpenCV-Based Processing* – Efficient eye-tracking and blink detection.  
🔹 *Simple & Lightweight* – Works with minimal setup.  

## 🛠 *Tech Stack*  
- *Python* – Core programming language  
- *OpenCV* – Image processing & computer vision  
- *Dlib* (optional) – For facial landmark detection  

## 🚀 *Installation & Setup*  
1. *Clone the repository*  
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blink-counter.git
   cd blink-counter
     
2. *Install dependencies*  
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
     
3. *Run the application*  
   bash
   python blinkcounter.py
     

## 📌 *How It Works*  
1️⃣ The program captures video from a webcam or input file.  
2️⃣ It detects eyes and tracks blinking patterns.  
3️⃣ The *total blink count* is displayed on the screen.  

## 🎥 *Example Output*  
A real-time video feed with the *blink count overlay*.  

## 🔧 *Future Enhancements*  
✅ Improved accuracy with deep learning models.  
✅ Support for different camera angles.  
✅ Data logging for long-term tracking.    

🚀 *Try it out & track your blink patterns effortlessly!*
